# Overview

This charm provides a bind server to store DNS records generated by designate.

# Usage

designate-bind relies on designate charm.

    juju deploy designate-bind
    juju deploy designate
    juju add-relation designate designate-bind

# Network Space support

This charm supports the use of Juju Network Spaces, allowing the charm
to be bound to network space configurations managed directly by Juju.
This is only supported with Juju 2.0 and above.

A network space to be used for communication with Designate can be
specified by "dns-backend" binding.

Extra binding can be specified with "dns-frontend" binding for an
additional network space to bind DNS server for clients outside of the
Juju model.

To use this feature, use the --bind option when deploying the charm:

    juju deploy designate-bind --bind "default-space dns-frontend=public-space dns-backend=internal-space"

alternatively these can also be provided as part of a juju native
bundle configuration:

    designate-bind:
      charm: cs:designate-bind
      num_units: 1
      bindings:
        '': default-space
        dns-frontend: public-space
        dns-backend: internal-space

NOTE: Spaces must be configured in the underlying provider prior to
attempting to use them.
